## 📊 좋아요 순위

1. **Emu3.5: Native Multimodal Models are World Learners** - 👍 932
   - [HF 페이지](https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.26583)
   - [논문 링크](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26583)
   - Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction object...

2. **Kimi Linear: An Expressive, Efficient Attention Architecture** - 👍 844
   - [HF 페이지](https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.26692)
   - [논문 링크](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26692)
   - Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across various scenarios -- including short-context, long-c...

3. **Remote Labor Index: Measuring AI Automation of Remote Work** - 👍 47
   - [HF 페이지](https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.26787)
   - [논문 링크](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26787)
   - Abstract: AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and reasoning, but it remains unclear how these gains translate into economic value and automation. To measure this, we introd...

4. **The End of Manual Decoding: Towards Truly End-to-End Language Models** - 👍 34
   - [HF 페이지](https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.26697)
   - [논문 링크](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26697)
   - Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. Thi...

5. **OmniX: From Unified Panoramic Generation and Perception to
  Graphics-Ready 3D Scenes** - 👍 33
   - [HF 페이지](https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.26800)
   - [논문 링크](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26800)
   - Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generat...

6. **Are Video Models Ready as Zero-Shot Reasoners? An Empirical Study with
  the MME-CoF Benchmark** - 👍 22
   - [HF 페이지](https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.26802)
   - [논문 링크](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26802)
   - Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emergin...

7. **AMO-Bench: Large Language Models Still Struggle in High School Math
  Competitions** - 👍 16
   - [HF 페이지](https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.26768)
   - [논문 링크](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26768)
   - Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems. Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high s...

8. **Magentic Marketplace: An Open-Source Environment for Studying Agentic
  Markets** - 👍 16
   - [HF 페이지](https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.25779)
   - [논문 링크](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25779)
   - Abstract: As LLM agents advance, they are increasingly mediating economic decisions, ranging from product discovery to transactions, on behalf of users. Such applications promise benefits but also raise many qu...

9. **FullPart: Generating each 3D Part at Full Resolution** - 👍 13
   - [HF 페이지](https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.26140)
   - [논문 링크](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26140)
   - Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications. Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens often suffer from insufficient geometric details...

10. **Can Agent Conquer Web? Exploring the Frontiers of ChatGPT Atlas Agent in
  Web Games** - 👍 0
   - [HF 페이지](https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.26298)
   - [논문 링크](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26298)
   - Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction, enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser...
